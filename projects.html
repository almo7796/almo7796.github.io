									This is a website I created with a fellow student that shows where in the world a type of cocktail is mentioned on Twitter the most. The website uses the Twitter API to aggregate tweets and display on a map where in the world they appear most often. The website is designed to handle tens of thousands of incoming tweets from Twitter. I created the Node.js server, the database, and transformed the data. In addition, I helped with the design of the website and worked on dynamically displaying the data. The website is containerized using Docker and it uses the Twitter API and the CocktailDB API. The website was hosted on GCP and uses a Mongo Atlas as our DB. The server is built using Node.js. Since it is not currently being hosted I have added a video of the project above.

								The "Guest Hospitality Website"(GHWVR) provides travelers with features such as check-in instructions, the ability to communicate with the property manager during their stay no matter what vacation rental app they booked through. GHWVR provides local attractions and recommendations, and the ability to submit reviews after their stay is complete.

									Goûter, which means "to taste" in French, is a website to find new recipes and rate them.This is a website that was created for my software engineering course. This was the first website I had made and to this day it is still one of my favorites. This website serves as a place to find new recipes as well as serve as a reviews site for recipes you made. Creating this website was the reason I decided to specialize in software engineering. This project taught me how to use a database, an API, how to containerize, and how to use many software engineering methods to make them all work with each other. The intricacies in the internet are still very incredible to me and this project taught me that it was something I love.
								</br>
							    </br>
									The website itself had some fun features that included a search bar that would allow you to search thousands of recipes depending on ingredients, or name of the dish. It also has the option to give you a random meal idea.
